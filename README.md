## Tools

## Projects

1. **PCAP Traffic Analysis**  
   - Captured suspicious traffic from sample PCAPs  
   - Tools: Wireshark  
   - Findings: Abnormal DNS queries, HTTP requests, potential C2 activity  

2. **Log Analysis (SIEM Simulation)**  
   - Investigated failed login attempts from sample logs  
   - Tools: Python, Excel  
   - Findings: Spike in login failures from single IP  

3. **Fraud → Cybersecurity Case Study**  
   - How skills in detecting fraud patterns translate to threat detection
