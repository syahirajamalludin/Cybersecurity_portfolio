# Cybersecurity Portfolio
Hands-on projects exploring PCAP analysis, log detection, and fraud-to-cybersecurity case studies.

Hi, I’m Nurul 👋  
Currently a Risk Data Analyst (Fraud Detection) with a Master’s in Data Science.  
Transitioning into Cybersecurity Analyst roles with a focus on **network traffic analysis, SIEM logs, and anomaly detection.**  

This portfolio documents my **hands-on learning journey**. 

## Objectives
To incorporate skills learned to fill the gap in getiing into cybersecurity.

## Tools

## Projects

1. **PCAP Traffic Analysis**  
   - Captured suspicious traffic from sample PCAPs  
   - Tools: Wireshark  
   - Findings: Abnormal DNS queries, HTTP requests, potential C2 activity  

2. **Log Analysis (SIEM Simulation)**  
   - Investigated failed login attempts from sample logs  
   - Tools: Python, Excel  
   - Findings: Spike in login failures from single IP  

3. **Fraud → Cybersecurity Case Study**
